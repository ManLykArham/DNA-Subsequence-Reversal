# 🧬 DNA Subsequence Reversal

## 🚀 Project Overview and Learning Outcomes

This project focuses on manipulating **DNA sequences** by identifying and reversing specific subsequences within a main DNA strand. The program takes a **main DNA string**, a **target subsequence**, a **prefix**, and a **suffix** as inputs. It searches for the target subsequence within the main string, ensuring it is flanked by the specified prefix and suffix. Once these conditions are met, the subsequence is **reversed in place** within the main string. This technique can be applied to studying **DNA patterns** and identifying potential mutations or specific sequences of interest in **bioinformatics**. 🧬

## ✨ Features

- **Pattern Search**: Identify a subsequence in a DNA string with specific flanking conditions.
- **In-Place Reversal**: Reverse the identified subsequence without altering the rest of the DNA string.
- **Biological Relevance**: Provides a simplified simulation of how DNA subsequence analysis can be useful in real-world **genetic research**.

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. **🧬 Input DNA String**:  
   - Provide a DNA sequence as the main string.
   
2. **🔍 Specify Target Subsequence**:  
   - Enter the subsequence to search for, along with the prefix and suffix.

3. **↩️ Reverse Matching Subsequences**:  
   - If the subsequence is found with the specified prefix and suffix, it will be reversed in the main string.

### 📊 Example Usage

- Input DNA string: `"ATGCGTAC"`
- Subsequence: `"CGT"`
- Prefix: `"G"`
- Suffix: `"A"`

**Expected Output**:  
`"ATGTGCAC"`
