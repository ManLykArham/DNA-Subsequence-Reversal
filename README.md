DNA-Subsequence-Reversal

This project involves manipulating DNA sequences by identifying specific subsequences within a main DNA string. The program takes a main string, a target subsequence, a prefix, and a suffix. It searches for the target subsequence in the main string, ensuring that the subsequence is flanked by the given prefix and suffix. If both conditions are met, the subsequence is reversed within the main string. This process helps in studying DNA sequences and identifying specific patterns or mutations.
